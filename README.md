MemeMe is a meme-generating app that enables a user to attach a caption to a picture from their phone. After adding text to an image chosen from the Photo Album or Camera, the user can share it with friends. MemeMe also temporarily stores sent memes which users can browse in a table or a grid.
##The app has three pages of content:
* Meme Editor View: Enables a user to add text to an image and share it. 
* Sent Memes View: Enables a user to browse sent memes in a table or a grid.
* Meme Detail View: Displays an image of a sent meme
